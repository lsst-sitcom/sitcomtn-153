Improving temperature control of the AuxTel WREB board

.. abstract::

   Tempeature control of the AuxTel WREB board was greatly improved by installing a script to control the cooling fan.  However, there are still temperature excursiond when the ambient temperature is too hot or too cold.  We have purchased from ELMEKO a Peltier cooling module, which can also heat, to improve the situation.  This technote describes the situation and the plans for implementing the Peltier cooler.
